# IWD website 2023

Hey WTM Algiers Ambassador, thanks for taking chance to be part of this project.

### Contribution guidelines to be FOLLOWED

- We're using **yarn** instead of *npm*. **DO NOT use npm**
- **All necessary** tailwind configurations(font sizes, colors, screen breakpoints) are specified in `./tailwind.config.cjs`. **DO NOT change this file**
- Issues are created for each section, assign to your self the desired section to work on.
- **First thing to do**
  - cloning the project
  - Installing the dependencies: *run the command* `yarn`
  - ```
        If you don't have yarn, make sure to install it globally using the command: npm install -g yarn
    ```
- **Follow the folder structure** (a folder tree is created for each section)
- Before start working on your section, **make sure** to create a branch following the convention: `feature/[section]/[your_name]`.e.g: `feature/hero/abdessamed`
- **DO NOT FORGET** to implement the 3 different screen sizes
  - `sm` breakpoint for small screens
  - `lg` breakpoint for large screens (1280px)
  - `2xl`breakpoint for extra large screens(1920px)
- Images, icons, colors, fonts **are all already configured**.
